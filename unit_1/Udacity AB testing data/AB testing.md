credit: Udacity A/B testing final project example

Udacity is an online learning platform geared toward tech professionals who want to develop skills in programming, data science, etc. These classes are intensive - both for the students and instructors - and the learning experience is best when students are able to dedicate enough time to the classes and there is not a lot of student churn.

Udacity wished to determine if presenting potential students with a screen that would remind them of the time commitment involved in taking a class would decrease the enrollment of students who were unlikely to succeed in the class.

At the time of the experiment, when a student selected a course, she was taken to the course overview page, where the student was presented with two options: "start free trial", and "access course materials".

If the student clicked "start free trial", she was asked to enter her credit card information and was enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course (which would covert to a paid membership after 14 days).

If the student clicked "access course materials", she could view the videos and take the quizzes for free but could not access all the features of the course such as coaching.

Here's the experiment: Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked "start free trial", she was asked how much time she had available to devote to the course.

If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, she would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If she indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free.

At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead.

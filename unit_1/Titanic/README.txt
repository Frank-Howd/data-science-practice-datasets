In the early hours of April 15, 1912, the unsinkable ship RMS Titanic sank 
when it struck an iceberg, killing more than half of the passengers and crew aboard. 
The Titanic.csv dataset contains demographic information for 889 of those passengers 
as well as a record of whether or not that each passenger survived.

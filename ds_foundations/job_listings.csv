In 2019, we were ranked #190 on Inc. 5000’s Fastest Growing Private Companies, and have been featured in Forbes, Buzzfeed, The New York Times, and the Daily Mail for our novel product and our rapid success.

Now, the company has identified and vetted an exciting new opportunity in the Food and Beverage space. We are focused on building a larger team that will drive innovative ideas into the industry, support product launches, and lead current and new businesses.

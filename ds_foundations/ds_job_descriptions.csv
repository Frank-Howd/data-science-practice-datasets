And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

Data Scientist,Citizen,New York State,"About Citizen

Citizen is a free app that keeps you and your loved ones safe. It is a powerful force for good that has already evacuated people from burning buildings, diverted school buses from nearby terrorist attacks and reunited missing children with their parents.

Using our unique technology, 911 alerts are made available to the public and are accompanied by live stories, real-time updates, and user-generated content to provide you with the information you need to protect yourself and your loved ones. We act fast, break news, and give people the immediate information they need to stay safe. And we're just getting started.

This year Citizen will expand further across the United States with the express mission of making your world a safer place. We're looking for hardworking, mission-driven individuals to help take the Citizen app to the next level as we scale up nationwide. With a group of passionate builders from Facebook, Square, Uber, Google and HQ Trivia, Citizen is the company your current company doesn't want you to know about.

Citizen is backed by Sequoia Capital, 8VC, Founders Fund, and Goodwater Capital and has raised tens of millions in VC funding.

Our Challenges
Scaling: We have one of the fastest-growing organic user bases in NYC, and have expanded to multiple other cities. We are focused on the nationwide launch and the need to support that scale. A Citizen international launch will follow.
Bursting: We designed our infrastructure to scale without notice in case of a spontaneous incident where we need to inform our entire user base. On significant events, we see over a million simultaneously connected clients and their associated live streams. The core systems need to be able to efficiently support these traffic patterns and continue to scale to millions of more users in the future.
Machine learning: We process thousands of hours of audio every day looking for incidents that impact our users' safety. To do this at scale, we've built ML models for audio analysis and targeting using the current state of the art from academia.
Analytics: We want to alert users to the incidents that matter to them, in a way that scales across different geographic densities and demographics.
Mobile video streaming: Our app will ingest high-quality video at low-latency, transcode, and redistribute the video to external media outlets seamlessly.
Radio hardware: We build our own software-defined radio-based devices to consume all radio dispatch in every major city, whether analog or digital.
Our Stack - languages we use and teach
Mobile: Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android)
Web: React.js, TypeScript
Services: Go for transactional systems; Python for analytical systems
Datastores: Cassandra, MySQL, Redis, Google PubSub

The mission of Citizen's Data team is to empower users with the information and intelligent products needed to keep everyone, everywhere safe. They are responsible for Citizen's entire data stack across data engineering, analysis, and machine learning.
Our core challenges come from intersecting our growing internal datasets on user behavior and real-time crime, fire, and medical incidents with large, messy external datasets from governmental and private sources in order to enable optimal decisions and maximally-useful products.
In this role you will:
Ask and answer challenging but critical product and strategy questions with data
Partner with cross-functional teams to develop effective products through iterative experimentation and analysis
Develop and maintain datasets and data tools in order to maximize team productivity
Requirements
3+ years of experience performing applied statistical analysis.

"Data Scientist, Product",Splice.com,New York State,"About the Role

We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Data and Insights team. In this role, you will define metrics used to track engagement, feature usage, and user-centric outcomes. You will use data to uncover user preferences and quantify product experiences, all with an aim of guiding our Search and Recommendations team to build more relevant and impactful experiences for our users.

All of this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that the necessary data is accessible and easy to use; regularly presenting findings to the Data and Insights team, Search and Recommendations team, as well as the company.

Skills we're looking for
Data manipulation

In our opinion, things that can be reasonably expressed in SQL, ought to be. We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means a fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.

Analysis

Right now, our bias is toward models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful policy suggestions. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.

Modeling

You should have hands-on experience building machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised) and know how to incorporate your models into production workflows and product experiences. At the outset, this role will largely focus on experimentation and more foundational product analysis; however, some degree of specialization in either preference learning and recommendations or text processing and search is expected.

Tooling expectations
Regular usage of a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (ideally Python).
Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data-warehouse technology).
Hands-on experience with self-service product-analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap).
Training in statistics, econometrics, or machine learning, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.
Exposure to data sets used by Product teams. Chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, Snowplow, server logs) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce and subscription datasets).
Additional comments

There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.

As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

Equal Opportunity Employer:
